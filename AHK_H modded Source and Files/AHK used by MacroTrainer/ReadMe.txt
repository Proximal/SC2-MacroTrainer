I only made a couple of very very minor changes to the source code.
The AutoHotkey.exe MacroTrainerAutoHotkeySC.bin contain these changes.
The DLL files are the standard AHK_H MD-32W released files.

The lib folder contains the library functions released with AHK_H. 
Never directly copy this library folder over the one included in the macro trainer base folder! Copy this one first if you must, and then overwrite with the other, as I may have made changed to some of those files.
