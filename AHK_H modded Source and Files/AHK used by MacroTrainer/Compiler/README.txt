Compiling: 

The compiler 'Ahk2Exe' comes in script and exe form. 

You can compile macro trainer by running the Ahk2Exe.exe file and specifying 
MacroTrainerAutoHotkeySC.bin as the Base File (.bin). This is the simplest method.

Note:
Ahk2Exe.exe itself has been compiled with the altered AHK used by macro trainer. If you attempt to use the standard AHK compilers you will receive an error ('Unrecognized Action') and the program WILL not fully compile, although you will be left with an exe.
