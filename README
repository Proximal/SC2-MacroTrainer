All Code used to compile and run MacroTrainer.

The code is written in AHK and is ran using a (very) slightly altered version of 
AHK_H 32W-MD (1.1.15.00).

If you are interested in SC2 memory functions, most (but not all) of these are inside 
"/lib/SC2_MemoryAndGeneralFunctions.ahk"

If you are looking for a general AHK memory reading/writing function check out 
"/lib/ClassMemory.ahk"

Running:

The code will not run using the standard AHK_H (or AHK_L) releases. 
If you really wish to run the program in script form, then you will need to use the
modded AHK_H files found in "AHK_H modded Source and Files\AHK used by MacroTrainer\"


Compiling:

Run the MacroCompiler.ahk script. 
Select an appropriate version/update-type.
Click the compile button.
The compiled EXE will be saved in \bin\currentMacroTrainer.zip

When compiling for personal use, be aware that setting the version/update-type to anything other than 'current' may prevent the auto-update feature from working.
