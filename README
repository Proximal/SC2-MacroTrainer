All Code used to compile and run MacroTrainer

Designed to be run using AHK_H-32-MD.

Running:

AHK_H can run the script as is.


Compiling for distribution:
Ensure the correct version numbers are set in the config, macro trainer, and macroTrainerCurrentVersion.ini files.

Compile the minimapThread.ahk using AHK_H 32Bit-MD (do not use compression). This will automatically include any called functions.

Use resource hacker (\Included Files\Resource Hacker) or winRar to extract the script from the RCData folder.
Save the script as threadMiniMapFull.ahk

Compile "macro trainer vX.XX.ahk" as "macro trainer vX.XX.exe" using AHK_H 32Bit-MD (do not use compression as this will prevent the change icon feature functioning). Zip the exe along with msvcr100.dll into currentMacroTrainer.zip and upload to FTP server.
