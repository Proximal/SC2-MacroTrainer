All Code used to compile and run MacroTrainer.

The code is written in AHK and is ran using a (very) slightly altered version of 
AHK_H 32W-MD.

If you are interested in SC2 memory functions, most (but not all) of these are inside 
"/lib/SC2_MemoryAndGeneralFunctions.ahk"

If you are looking for a general AHK memory reading/writing function check out 
"/lib/ClassMemory.ahk"

Running:

The code will not run using the standard AHK_H (or AHK_L) releases. 
If you really wish to run the program in script form, then you will need to use the
modded AHK_H files found in "AHK_H modded Source and Files\AHK used by MacroTrainer\"


Compiling for distribution:
Ensure the correct version numbers are set in the config, macro trainer, and macroTrainerCurrentVersion.ini files.

Compile the minimapThread.ahk using AHK_H 32Bit-MD (do not use compression). This will automatically include any called functions.

Use resource hacker (\Included Files\Resource Hacker) or winRar to extract the script from the RCData folder.
Save the script as threadMiniMapFull.ahk

Repeat the above steps for the threadOverlays.AHK and save as threadOverlaysFull.AHK

Compile "macro trainer vX.XX.ahk" as "macro trainer vX.XX.exe" using AHK_H 32Bit-MD (do not use compression as this will prevent the change icon feature functioning). Zip the exe along with msvcr100.dll into currentMacroTrainer.zip and upload to FTP server.
